Property-Based Testing
Types
1. Stateless
2. Stateful

Stateless
1. Generate random input
2. Test output(based on properties)
   ` Assert properties of the specification
   ` Check for exceptions
   ` Matches the golden standard or oracle   -  An implementation that we either know or beliveve to be correct
? why just use the gold standard ?
It often is in a different programming language, is inefficient, or doesn't consider security 

   ` Check any algebraic properties - Algebra is just a set of values and a set of operations

example
sort,reverse

sort(reverse(sort(array)))
should be equal to sort(array)


Stateful testing
` useful with data structures or collections
` golden standard is essential

1. Generate random program 
   ` Call a random number of random methods on object
2. Test object (based on properties)
   `Check for exceptions
   `Make sure output matches "golden standard"
   `CHeck any algebraic properties 


 Testing Equivlence with oracle 
 `slides 

 Testing algebraic properties (without oracle)
 ` run the random program on two instances or our implementation
 1. run random prefix(same as shown earlier)
 2. Test Algrbraic property
 3. Run random postifx
 4. Check that instances are equal
