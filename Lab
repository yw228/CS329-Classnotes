Should write not more than 30 Tests


Change dump code into something constant folding
Folding constant  
Type checker

AST Tree
DOM viewer
IBM Javadoc 


Constant folding 
Final int a = 8*128 -> Final int a = 1028


1. Literals in Parenthesis
2. Logical not applied to boolean literal(only when boolean)
3. Addition with number literals 
4. Less than with Number literals
5. If statement with boolean literals 
	

Constant folding
1. Write spec
2. Black box test
3. Implement foding it visitor class
4. Add the new folding class to ConstantFolding

if (15 < 3) // 2 and 4  // change to false in AST TREES
{
   x = 10;
} 
else      // delete the if left with the bottom parts
{
x = 5 + 6 +7 ; // 3  x = 18 final folded code 
}
