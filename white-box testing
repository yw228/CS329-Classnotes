white-box testing
` Structure of the code
black-box testing
` looks at the interface of the code (functionality of the code)

white-box testing
` dervies coverage meterics that represent different levels of test effort
black-box testing
` deal with equivalence partitions and boundary-value analysis

white-box testing - how the program is written and structured
` statement coverage
` condition coverage
` Decision or Branch coverage
` MC/DC coverage

Statement coverage (weakest)
- Each statement in executed at least once by some test

Condition coverage (weak)
- Every condidtion in a decision in the program has excuseted 
- Testing for the if / while / else 

Decision or Branch coverage
- every point of entery and exit in the program is tested 
- everything dicsion in the program also is tested

Test1  F || F
Test2  T || F
