Integration Tests
` Test code that Integrates multiple parts of the system
` Takes longer to run than Unit Tests, we often split them into their folder
Maven Test
`Test phase
`Integration-test
Test failed
Integration will not run


Continuous Intergration (CI)
` The practices of automating intertation and testing of code changes from multiple contributors

` Jenkins
` Github Hooks

Constant Propagration
Fixed-Point Algorithm: repeat until the AST changed
1. Constant folding
2. Construct the control flow graph
3. Perfom reaching definitions
4. Propagation : 




int x  = 13 ;  S1
if (x < 12){}    (x,s1)




Testing for project 1 part 3
Write Integration Test for the entire constant propagation algorithm
